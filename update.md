 Hey, Christian Barajas here, I am going to be using this to see what I need to update within the site with Viviviviviviviviviviiviviviviviviviviviiv

 Index.html on FIRST page is broken - need to debug
 Yeah, im debugging. Ill be able to fix it when I get home since its better than this crappy chromebook

 I fixed some of the first page, the code was poorly written with a bunch of nonsense. I am still working on it but I have restored basic page connectivity. Alright cool, where did the tabs go? Like games, TNfirst etc - Did u just copy and paste code fro mnewsletter into First so its simpler now?


I nuked the page on accident then I was uploading new code to the FIRST page, I stripped the news page and replaced it with first stuff. 

- Replace images on all parts of website!
- Add 2023 game and update to add 2024 later when released
- Take and add pictures of new team leads
- delete buisness on about page and combine with Branding to make marketing
-bug on homepage
